- You have installed [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli):

```bash
terraform -help # prints Terraform options
```

## Domain set-up

- Add the GCP credentials JSON `client_email` as an owner of the domain. See Cloud Storage documentation [here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/domain-name-verification#additional_verified_owners)

```bash
project                = <GCP-PROJECT-ID>
bucket_name            = <STATIC-SITE-BUCKET-NAME>
cloud_source_repo_name = <CLOUD-SOURCE-REPOSITORY-NAME>
# and other variables
```

- Create a secret on [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) for Cloud SQL database password

## Deploy

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login # authenticate with GCP
cd deploy # change to deploy directory
terraform init # initialises Terraform
terraform apply # deploys GCP stack
terraform destroy # destroys GCP stack
```

## Build/run app locally

- Create a `.env` file with the following, and place at project root directory:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=<CLOUDFUNCTION-TRIGGER-URL>
```

- Run `npm run start` and visit aapp at `http://localhost:3000`

## Domain configuration
